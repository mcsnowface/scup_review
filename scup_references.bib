	abstract = {A few studies in young mixedwood stands demonstrate that precommercial thinning of aspen at early ages can improve the growth of spruce and increase stand resilience to drought. However, information on tree and stand responses to thinning in older mixedwood stands is lacking. To address this need, a study was initiated in 2008 in Alberta, Canada in 14 boreal mixedwood stands (seven each at ages 17 and 22). This study investigated growth responses following thinning of aspen to ﬁve densities (0, 1000, 2500, 5000 stems ha−1 and unthinned (control)). Measurements were collected in the year of establishment, and three and eight years later. Mortality of aspen in the unthinned plots was greater than in the thinned plots which were not signiﬁcantly different amongst each other. Eight years following treatment, aspen diameter was positively inﬂuenced by thinning, while there was no effect on aspen height. The density of aspen had no signiﬁcant effect on the survival of planted spruce. Spruce height and diameter growth increased with both aspen thinning intensity and time since treatment. Differentiation among treatments in spruce diameter growth was evident three years from treatment, while differentiation in height was not signiﬁcant until eight years following treatment. Yield projections using two growth models (Mixedwood Growth Model (MGM) and Growth and Yield Projection System (GYPSY)) were initialized using data from the year eight re-measurements. Results indicate that heavy precommercial aspen thinning (to {\textasciitilde}1000 aspen crop trees ha−1) can result in an increase in conifer merchantable volume without reducing aspen volume at the time of harvest. However, light to moderate thinning (to {\textasciitilde}2500 aspen stems ha−1 or higher), is unlikely to result in gains in either deciduous or conifer merchantable harvest volume over those of unthinned stands.},

Wood anatomical studies frequently provide several quantitative details of these cells, such as vessel diameter, vessel density, vessel element length, and tracheid length, while important information on the three dimensional structure of the hydraulic network is not considered. This paper aims to provide an overview of various techniques, although there is no standard protocol to quantify conduits due to high anatomical variation and a wide range of techniques available. Despite recent progress in image analysis programs and automated methods for measuring cell dimensions, density, and spatial distribution, various characters remain time-consuming and tedious. Quantiﬁcation of vessels and tracheids is not only important to better understand functional adaptations of tracheary elements to environment parameters, but will also be essential for linking wood anatomy with other ﬁelds such as wood development, xylem physiology, palaeobotany, and dendrochronology.},

Data were collected from two study sites located north of Big River Saskatchewan, which were regenerated following clearcutting in 1992 and thinned in 1996 to ﬁve aspen densities and two spruce densities. Results show signiﬁcant decreases in spruce diameter at breast height (DBH), height, live crown ratio, maximum branch diameter in the lower 2 m, average branch diameter in the whorl closest to 1 m, and increases in tree slenderness with increases in aspen density. Increasing spruce density reduced the number of live branches and number of live branch whorls in the lower 2 m. Maximum branch diameter in the whorl closest to 1 m was inﬂuenced by both aspen and spruce density, with a signiﬁcant interaction term resulting from effects of intraspeciﬁc competition being evident for aspen densities of 1500 stems ha−1 or lower. DBH and slenderness explained more than 49\% of the variation in spruce crown width, maximum branch diameter in the lower 2 m, maximum live branch diameter in the whorl closest to 1 m, and average live branch diameter in the whorl closest to 1 m. DBH explained more variation in crown width and branch diameter than slenderness. This study demonstrates that growing spruce in mixture with aspen can lead to reductions in branch size and that early thinning to low aspen densities could lead to increases in size of knots and associated reductions in wood quality, particularly when spruce densities are low.},

The BARG encompass the features of previous guidelines, while including many additional details for contemporary Bayesian analyses, with explanations. An extensive example of applying the BARG is presented. The BARG should be useful to researchers, authors, reviewers, editors, educators and students. Utilization, endorsement and promotion of the BARG may improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of Bayesian analyses.},

The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist.

Pre-commercial and commercial thinning were applied to a portion of the better sites, which allowed shortening of the time to merchantability and earlier harvest than unthinned stands; less than 25\% of the forest was thinned over the course of the plan. The sustainable harvest rate, represented here as the annual allowable cut (AAC), increased by ∼14\% above baseline, when thinning was applied. Similarly, there was a 20.7\% increase in AAC projected with the relaxation of even flow rules if thinning was also applied. Finally, thinning offset the expected decline in AAC after a 20-year surge in cutting of mature pine, designed to slow an epidemic of mountain pine beetle. In terms of wood supply, the volume extracted at thinning was {\textless}2\% of annual supply but volume from final harvest from thinned stands, at times, surpassed that of unthinned stands of the forest. Individual tree size from thinned stands was ∼twice that from unthinned areas in the second part of the planning period, offsetting the expected decline in piece size after the era of harvest of natural forests.},

In this paper, we focus on translating domain expert knowledge into corresponding prior distributions over model parameters, a process known as prior elicitation. Expert knowledge can manifest itself in diverse formats, including information about raw data, summary statistics, or model parameters. A major challenge for existing elicitation methods is how to effectively utilize all of these different formats in order to formulate prior distributions that align with the expert's expectations, regardless of the model structure. To address these challenges, we develop a simulation-based elicitation method that can learn the hyperparameters of potentially any parametric prior distribution from a wide spectrum of expert knowledge using stochastic gradient descent. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our elicitation method in four representative case studies covering linear models, generalized linear models, and hierarchical models. Our results support the claim that our method is largely independent of the underlying model structure and adaptable to various elicitation techniques, including quantile-based, moment-based, and histogram-based methods.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

	abstract = {Changing climates are altering the structural and functional components of forest ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, we are seeing a diversification of public expectations on the broader sustainable use of forest resources beyond timber production. As a result, the science and art of silviculture needs to adapt to these changing realities. In this piece, we argue that silviculturists are gradually shifting from the application of empirically derived silvicultural scenarios to new sets of approaches, methods and practices, a process that calls for broadening our conception of silviculture as a scientific discipline. We propose a holistic view of silviculture revolving around three key themes: observe, anticipate and adapt. In observe, we present how recent advances in remote sensing now enable silviculturists to observe forest structural, compositional and functional attributes in near-real-time, which in turn facilitates the deployment of efficient, targeted silvicultural measures in practice that are adapted to rapidly changing constraints. In anticipate, we highlight the importance of developing state-of-the-art models designed to take into account the effects of changing environmental conditions on forest growth and dynamics. In adapt, we discuss the need to provide spatially explicit guidance for the implementation of adaptive silvicultural actions that are efficient, cost-effective and socially acceptable. We conclude by presenting key steps towards the development of new tools and practical knowledge that will ensure meeting societal demands in rapidly changing environmental conditions. We classify these actions into three main categories: re-examining existing silvicultural trials to identify key stand attributes associated with the resistance and resilience of forests to multiple stressors, developing technological workflows and infrastructures to allow for continuous forest inventory updating frameworks, and implementing bold, innovative silvicultural trials in consultation with the relevant communities where a range of adaptive silvicultural strategies are tested. In this holistic perspective, silviculture can be defined as the science of observing forest condition and anticipating its development to apply tending and regeneration treatments adapted to a multiplicity of desired outcomes in rapidly changing realities.},

	abstract = {Strict forest renewal policies in western Canada focus on replicating the stand type that was cut and projecting the growth of young stands forward using simple models based upon past growing conditions. These policies arose from European principles of sustained yield and now limit options for adaptive management at the time of investment in forest renewal of public lands. We assert that such simple and restrictive policies, combined with long-term yield predictions, give a false sense of sustainability in times of increased drought, fires, and insect and disease attacks that accompany climate change. We must undertake comprehensive changes in forest policy that incorporate disturbance in our forest management planning. This is a large task! Options include (i) zoning public forests to vary intensities of management and minimize risk; (ii) changing stand- and forest-level models to increase the diversity of forests regenerated; (iii) widening the sphere of scientific experts that can influence forest policy and risk management; and (iv) reallocating expenditures on forest renewal, protection, and management to minimize negative impacts of disturbance. Such a comprehensive overhaul of forest management will be necessary as the current assumptions of forest sustainability come under further scrutiny by the public and investors.},

	abstract = {Understory protection harvesting is a form of partial cutting that can be used in aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.)-dominated stands that have understories of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). This practice involves removing 75\% to 85\% of the merchantable aspen while minimizing damage to the advance spruce regeneration, in addition to leaving 15\% to 25\% of the aspen standing to reduce potential windthrow of the spruce understory. In this paper, we summarize results from 18 stands measured 10 to 12 years after understory protection harvest. Diameter growth of spruce increased during the first five years after harvest while height growth increased during the second five-year period (5 to 10 or 7 to 12 years after release). Consistent with other studies, mortality rates of aspen trees ≥7.1 cm DBH (diameter breast height, 1.3 m) averaged 45.0\% over the 10–12 year period following harvesting. Spruce mortality averaged 27.5\% over the same 10–12 year period. Substantial aspen regeneration was evident across most harvested blocks, with aspen sapling densities 10–12 years from harvest being higher in removal (14,637 stems⋅ha−1) than in buffer areas (6686 stems⋅ha−1) and in extraction trails (7654 stems⋅ha−1). Spruce sapling ({\textgreater}1.3 m height and {\textless}4 cm DBH) densities averaged 1140 stems⋅ha−1 in removal areas at ages 10–12, with these trees likely being present as seedlings at the time of harvest. Mixedwood Growth Model projections indicate merchantable volumes averaging 168 m3⋅ha−1 (conifer) and 106 m3⋅ha−1 (deciduous) 70 years from harvest, resulting in MAI (mean annual increment) for this period averaging 2.0 m3⋅ha−1⋅y−1 with MAI for a full 150-year rotation of approximately 2.5 m3⋅ha−1⋅y−1.},

	abstract = {A large component of the boreal mixedwood forest is comprised of aspen and white spruce mixtures of varying proportions and ages. The slower growing white spruce usually starts as an understory component but will succeed to a white sprucedominated stand after aspen break-up. Since both species are utilized by the forest industry, one method of maximizing total yield is to protect the unmerchantable white spruce understory while harvesting the merchantable aspen overstory. Although some of the white spruce understory is lost when the machine corridors are harvested, future conifer yield is augmented by the accelerated growth of the protected spruce component, a result of increased light levels. In a 10 year trial comparing the growth of released versus control understory spruce, annual height growth, diameter growth and volume increment were 76\%, 152\% and 83\% higher, respectively, for the released conifer compared to the control. In order to account for the yield implications in timber supply analysis, accurate forecasts of future stand development can only be obtained through the use of a forest growth model since long-term data are not available. The Mixedwood Growth Model (MGM) has a unique architecture that allows for the modeling of various strata in understory protection stands. This “multi-strata” modeling approach was used to forecast the combined yield of all the strata, including the impact of adjacent strata with regards to light availability. Operational examples of understory protection, data on white spruce release and aspen regeneration, as well as modeled volume forecasts are presented.},

	abstract = {Two sequential projects were implemented in boreal mixedwoods in Alberta. Project 1480, initiated in 1988, tested the planning and application of silvicultural and harvesting systems designed to protect immature (understory) white spruce during the harvest of aspen overstory, realize the growth potential of residual spruce, and encourage aspen regeneration. Silvicultural prescriptions were based on a two-stage harvesting and tending stand level model. Results show that, using conventional harvesting equipment, and with adequate planning, crew training, and supervision, 50–60\% of spruce understory trees can be protected during the harvest of overstory deciduous trees; most wind damage will occur in the first 3 post-harvest years. Five years after the first-stage harvest, spruce growth shows significant height, diameter, and volume response, and aspen regeneration is adequate. The potential yield in 60 years from a second harvest of spruce and aspen seems promising. Project 8032, initiated in 1992, tested the effectiveness of a range of silvicultural and harvesting systems in reducing wind damage to residual spruce on moist-to-wet sites after harvest of the deciduous overstory. The project includes studies of harvesting costs, productivity, mixedwood growth and yield, aspen regeneration, wind damage, and wind behavior within cutblocks. Initial results show that the silvicultural systems and cutblock designs implemented provide a range of residual spruce wind protection and that, using conventional roadside equipment, a variety of silvicultural options can be achieved.},
